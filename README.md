Vigen√®re Tools
==============

tabula.py
---------
This script will generate a table for you on stdout, based on the minimum and maximum characters in the range.
Currently it will generate a table for all printable ascii characters, in order that they appear in the standard table.
Modify the characters min/max in order they appear to change the range of characters you generate a table for.

vigenere.py
-----------
This script will decrypt a message with a key, on the basis the message was encrypted with a _tabula recta_ taking the form of the table generated by `tabula.py`.
In other words, you need to ensure that `ascii_min` and `ascii_max` each represent the minimum and maximum character in the ascii table standard order that was used by the person encrypting.
Currently the key and ciphertext are hardcoded under `__main__`, for the 44Con 2014 CTF challenge.
